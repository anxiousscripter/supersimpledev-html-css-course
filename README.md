# SuperSimpleDev HTML & CSS Practice Exercises

This repository contains my solutions to the HTML and CSS practice exercises from SuperSimpleDev’s HTML and CSS course. The purpose of this project is to reinforce core front-end concepts through hands-on practice.

The code in this repository reflects my learning progress as I work through each lesson’s exercises. These solutions are meant for practice and learning rather than as polished, production-ready projects.

# Repository Structure

The repository is organized by lesson. Each folder corresponds to a lesson from the course and contains one or more exercises related to that lesson.

# Technologies Used

> > HTML5
> > CSS3

No frameworks, libraries, or preprocessors are used unless an exercise explicitly requires them.

# Notes

> > The solutions reflect my understanding at the time they were written.
> > Some exercises may have multiple valid solutions; these represent my own approach.
> > Earlier exercises may be revisited and improved as my skills develop.

# Status

This repository is actively being updated as I continue completing the course exercises.
